                <p class="intro">Discord for Mensans is the next step in the evolution of seamless global communication.</p>

                <div class="cta-container">
                    <a href="https://discord.gg/RfvnT7NKFh" class="cta-button cta-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Join Discord for Mensans Now</a>
                </div>

                <p>Imagine a place where Mensan conversations are no longer limited to a small group.</p>

                <p>Imagine a place where Mensan conversations are no longer limited to a geographic region.</p>

                <p>Imagine a place where Mensan conversations are no longer limited to one room on a specific platform that only exists to sell advertising.</p>

                <p>Everything you do on other platforms can be done here–but bigger and better–by unifying the good things you like under one global roof in a house with 145,000 Mensans and built for you to easily converse on a topic with thousands then–with a single click or tap–engage a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_of_Silence_(Get_Smart)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cone of silence</a> and step into your own room to speak privately.</p>

                <p><strong>No more isolation by topic.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>No more isolation by group.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>No more isolation by platform or device.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>No more defining your Mensan identity through a single lens.</strong></p>

                <p>Discord for Mensans is device agnostic, OS agnostic, platform agnostic and free.</p>

                </div>

                <h3>Bring your Group/SIG/Event here</h3>

                <p>No cost & no administration–request public or private room(s)/channel(s) for your Group/SIG/Event for growth benefit from global exposure while offering your members single click/tap access to Mensans worldwide.</p>

                <p>Grow your local group through optional public channels that allow potential new members transparency to ask questions and learn the benefits of Mensa membership with you.</p>
